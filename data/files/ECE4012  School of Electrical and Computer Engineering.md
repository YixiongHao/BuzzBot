### Catalog Description

Second semester of ECE culminating design sequence. Team project in ECE
incorporating engineering standards and realistic constraints. Requires formal
reports and group presentations.

### Textbook(s)

Fundamentals of Engineering Design

### Course Outcomes

  1. Understand how professional issues (teamwork, ethics, licensure, engineering standards, social factors, environmental factors, and economic factors) relate to the practice of engineering design.
  2. Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
  3. Create engineering designs to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
  4. Effectively communicate engineering designs with a range of audiences.
  5. Exercise leadership skills.
  6. Understand issues, methods and tools used in the engineering practice.
  7. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
  8. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
  9. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. 
  10. Effectively communicate engineering designs with a range of audiences.
  11. Exercise leadership skills.
  12. Understand issues, methods and tools used in the engineering practice.
  13. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
  14. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
  15. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. 

### Student Outcomes

In the parentheses for each Student Outcome:  
"P" for primary indicates the outcome is a major focus of the entire course.  
“M” for moderate indicates the outcome is the focus of at least one component
of the course, but not majority of course material.  
“LN” for “little to none” indicates that the course does not contribute
significantly to this outcome.

1\. ( P ) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics

2\. ( P ) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that
meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors

3\. ( P ) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences

4\. ( M ) An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in
engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the
impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts

5\. ( P ) An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together
provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment,
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives

6\. ( P ) An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation,
analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions

7\. ( P ) An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
appropriate learning strategies.

### Course Objectives

### Topical Outline

Working in teams, students will complete the second semester of their two-
semester design project requiring specification, design, implementation, and
testing. Projects must be based on the knowledge and skills acquired in
earlier course work, and incorporate appropriate engineering standards and
multiple realistic constraints. For teams including CmpE majors, the project
must incorporate both hardware and software design elements and trade-offs
between the two. Emphasis is placed on the design process, the technical
aspects of the design, and on reducing the proposed design to practice.
