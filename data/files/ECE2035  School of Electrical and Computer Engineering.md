### Catalog Description

Creation of complex execution and storage mechanisms, based on instruction set
architecture, for software design including high-level programming languages
and operating systems. Programming design projects.

### Textbook(s)

Introduction to Computing Systems

### Course Outcomes

  1. Develop a software design using appropriate data and procedural abstractions given an engineering problem specification
  2. Implement high-level programming language storage, control, and procedural constructs in the assembly language of a hardware platform.
  3. Use commonly available tools for software development, system management, debugging, performance monitoring, and optimization.
  4. Develop a software system that uses multiple files and libraries.
  5. Develop, test, and deploy reliable software using appropriate operating system capabilities (e.g., file and directory access, I/O interface).

### Student Outcomes

In the parentheses for each Student Outcome:  
"P" for primary indicates the outcome is a major focus of the entire course.  
“M” for moderate indicates the outcome is the focus of at least one component
of the course, but not majority of course material.  
“LN” for “little to none” indicates that the course does not contribute
significantly to this outcome.

1\. ( P ) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics

2\. ( LN ) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that
meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors

3\. ( LN ) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences

4\. ( LN ) An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities
in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the
impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts

5\. ( LN ) An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together
provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment,
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives

6\. ( P ) An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation,
analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions

7\. ( M ) An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
appropriate learning strategies.
