**Abstract:** An exploration of a 38-year US Government career focused
initially on secure telecommunications and now focused on cybersecurity. He
will describe his current work at National Institute of Standards and
Technology’s applied cybersecurity laboratory and share insights about
cybersecurity and cybersecurity work in the US Government. Along the way, he
will share some highlights of his work, places visited, and communities of
interest where he has tried to make an impact.

**Bio:** Bill Newhouse is a cybersecurity Engineer at NIST’s National
Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) where he co-leads the Migration to
Post-Quantum Cryptography project, a collaboration with industry and
government, to share insights on practices that will ease the migration to
Post-Quantum Cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-
based attacks. He is active in US Government interagency research and
development coordination groups which has allowed him the opportunity to
steward the development of two national cybersecurity research and development
strategic plans. Mr. Newhouse has been with the U.S. Federal government since
1986. Initially, his career focused on telecommunications, then information
assurance, and now cybersecurity. He studied Electrical Engineering at the
Georgia Institute of Technology (graduation Dec 1990) and has a master’s
degree in Telecommunications and Computers from the George Washington
University (graduation Aug 2001). He completed seven cooperative work quarters
at the National Security Agency and then transitioned to full-time employment
after graduating from Georgia Tech in December 1990. He worked for NSA until
March 2010 and has been at NIST for the last 14+ years.
