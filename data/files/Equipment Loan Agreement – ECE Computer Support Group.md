**Step 1:** Click the link for the ECE Equipment Loan Agreement at the end of
this page.

**Step 2:** Your information will automatically populate in the Sender field,
so verify that information is correct. Then follow the appropriate set of

**

  * **For students :** Scroll down to the Equipment Lender / Advisor recipient and please choose the address book icon to ensure the recipient signs in with Georgia Tech credentials. This will allow them to track the progress of your document and access your signature request in DocuSign. Then continue to **Step 3**.

**Step 3:** When you scroll to the bottom of the screen, you can check a box
to create custom email and language for each recipient. If you wish to send
the same email to all recipients, uncheck this box.

**Step 4:** Once you have entered all requested information, select “SEND.”

After clicking SEND, the document is electronically routed via email to each
recipient. You, as the sender and first recipient, will complete the form in
DocuSign (via the email link you receive or in your DocuSign account). When
you sign the form, you will notice that the other recipients’ names are not
included on the form. Don’t worry – they will be automatically filled in when
the other recipients open the form.

When all recipients have finished signing the document, everyone will receive
a PDF copy of the signed form via email attachment. Save the attachments since
DocuSign only retains documents for 6 months.
