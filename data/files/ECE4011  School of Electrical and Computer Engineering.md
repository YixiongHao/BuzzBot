### Catalog Description

First semester of ECE culminating design sequence. Design tools, financial
principles, project management, probabilistic and statistical techniques, team
forming. Requires formal reports and group presentations.

### Textbook(s)

Fundamentals of Engineering Design

### Course Outcomes

  1. Describe factors and constraints associated with product development and life cycles
  2. Apply statistics to analysis of engineering problems, including component and manufacturing variation, project scheduling, and product reliability
  3. Solve basic problems in engineering economy, including use of time-value-of-money principles for decision making
  4. Describe considerations in professional engineering practice, including licensure, ethics, standards, intellectual property, and liability
  5. Perform a literature search on a specific technical subject and prepare a summary report
  6. Form and effectively function as a team to define, plan, and develop a design project of appropriate scope, depth, and breadth
  7. As part of a team, describe qualitative design goals and determine quantitative design specifications to meet the goals
  8. As part of a team, prepare a project timeline in an appropriate format that includes tasks, critical paths, and milestones
  9. As part of a team, prepare a project budget that includes, as appropriate, development costs, manufacturing costs, and profit
  10. As part of a design team, prepare a design project proposal that effectively communicates information in written and graphical form

### Student Outcomes

In the parentheses for each Student Outcome:  
"P" for primary indicates the outcome is a major focus of the entire course.  
“M” for moderate indicates the outcome is the focus of at least one component
of the course, but not majority of course material.  
“LN” for “little to none” indicates that the course does not contribute
significantly to this outcome.

1\. ( P ) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics

2\. ( P ) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that
meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors

3\. ( P ) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences

4\. ( P ) An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in
engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the
impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts

5\. ( P ) An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together
provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment,
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives

6\. ( P ) An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation,
analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions

7\. ( P ) An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
appropriate learning strategies.
