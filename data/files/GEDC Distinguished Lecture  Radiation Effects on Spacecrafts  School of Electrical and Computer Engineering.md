**Abstract:  **Space can be a harsh environment for electrical components due
to large temperature swings and the presence of high-energy particles. This
talk will focus on the radiation effects associated with high-energy particles
found in space and their impact on spacecrafts. We will initially cover some
basic history of radiation effects and its associated physics. Afterwards, the
radiation effects will be tied to system-level impact in spacecrafts and
potential mitigation options.

**Bio:** Anup Omprakash received his BS in Electrical Engineering in 2013 and
his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering in 2019 from Georgia Tech, where he worked
on the extreme environment (high temperature and radiation) operation of
Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors (SiGe HBTs) and SiGe HBT-
based circuits. He is currently working at Raytheon Technologies as a
Radiation Effects Engineer in El Segundo, CA.

##### Pizza and soda will be available after the seminar.
