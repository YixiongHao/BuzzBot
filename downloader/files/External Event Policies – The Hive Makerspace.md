# The Hive Makerspace Policies Regarding Collaborations with On-Campus
Organizations

Updated February 22, 2024

The Hive Makerspace is an organization dedicated to improving the Georgia Tech
student experience by providing a place to create hands-on projects, training
peer instructors to assist students in using our various machinery and
professional tools, and hosting workshops to teach topics from basic
electronics to how to make a DIY smart watch.

To better serve the Georgia Tech community, the Hive is open to collaborating
with other on-campus organizations on events such as workshops or info
sessions on professional topics, given that proposed collaboration events fall
within the following guidelines:

  1. The Hiveâ€™s objective is to serve the _entire_ student population. Therefore, all collaboration events must be open to the entirety of the student population. We do not allow other clubs or organizations to host private events in our Makerspace. To prevent this, members of the organization we are collaborating with may not fill up more than 50% of the available slots for the event, and we have the authority to remove members from the signup list at our discretion to correct for any sign ups in excess of this amount.
  2. The Hive shall oversee the entire RSVP process. Organizations are not allowed to post their own signups for the event on Engage. We have ultimate control of the list of attendees for all events held in the space, and we may revise the attendee list if we feel the signup process is not adequately catered to all Georgia Tech students. 
  3. Collaboration ideas must be submitted at least a month prior to the proposed date to provide time for ordering materials and determining event logistics.
  4. The Hive has the final say over the logistics of the event, including but not limited to, the date it occurs, the time of day the event occurs, and the number of attendees allowed for the event.
  5. Collaborating organizations must provide something of value to the event, such as materials to be used in the event, food for attendees, volunteers to help run the event, and/or presentation materials for the event. What constitutes something of value is determined at our discretion.
  6. Before releasing the event to the public for signup, The Hive requires a meeting with the collaborating organization to confirm all preliminary setup has been completed. This meeting is to check items such as making sure all necessary materials have arrived, a presentation for the event has been finalized, etc.

Our executive board runs meetings weekly on Monday, so if our organization has
not responded to your event proposal within a week, feel free to email us
again at hive@ece.gatech.edu.
