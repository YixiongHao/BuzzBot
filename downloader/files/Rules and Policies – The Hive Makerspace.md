## Purpose

This document serves as the official collection of the rules and policies of
the Interdisciplinary Design Commons (herein referred to as “The IDC,” “The
Hive Makerspace,” “The Hive,” or simply, “the space”) to be adhered to by all
who enter the space. These apply in addition to Georgia Tech’s official legal
policies, campus use policies, and student code of conduct. This document may
be modified at any time at the discretion of The Hive Staff and The Hive
Executive Board.

## Mission

Our mission is to cultivate an interdisciplinary, collaborative culture of
student makers and designers who are passionate about learning new skills,
helping other students, and above all, bringing their ideas to reality. By
providing an easily accessible engineering space on Georgia Tech’s campus and
staffing it with trained student instructors, we create an area where students
can learn from other students, developing both technical skills and ideas as
well as personal connections. Though we were born from the ECE department, we
are not limited to serve only ECE students. Our goal is to provide a space
where any Georgia Tech student - regardless of technical knowledge, skill,
major, year or background - can walk in, feel welcome, and make their
imagination reality.

## Values and Principles

We aim to help students gain hands on skills and technical knowledge by
providing a comfortable, low-pressure learning environment in which any
student has room to grow and explore. We believe that every student should
have the equipment to create anything they want to create. We believe that
diversity - in all forms - makes us stronger. We believe in students helping
students to foster collaboration, promote new ideas, and learn technical
skills that may not be taught in class. The Hive is a staunch advocate of
"maker culture", facilitating growth and inventive ideas, and providing the
tools that our students need to achieve their dreams of creating the next big
thing. We are passionate about sharing knowledge, helping others, and leading
technological advancement in an era of rapid prototyping. We are innovators,
cultivators, and achievers.

1.2.2.

    The policies in this document are subject to change at the discretion of Staff and the Executive Board. The Executive Board may modify this document but must inform Staff of any such policy changes made. Staff shall be the ultimate authority on policy changes. This document will be maintained by Staff and will remain available to the public. Any changes of significance, as determined at the discretion of Staff and the Executive Board, will be communicated to all PIs and, as necessary, to the public.
1.2.3.

    Staff and the Executive Board may waive policies for specific individuals or situations at their discretion. However, the Executive Board must inform Staff of any such waivers issued by them. Staff shall be the ultimate authority on policy waivers.

### 1.3 Technical Areas

1.3.1.

    The Hive shall consist of the following technical areas: benchtop electronics, 3D printing, laser cutting, machine shop, crafts, PCB fabrication, and embedded systems. All PIs shall be trained in benchtop electronics, 3D printing, laser cutting, and at least one of the remaining technical areas.

### 1.4 End Users

1.4.1.

    An end user is defined as any member of the Georgia Tech community (student, faculty, staff, or other affiliate who possesses an active BuzzCard), who enters The Hive Makerspace and is not a Peer Instructor, member of the Executive Board, or member of The Hive Staff.

### 1.5. Peer Instructors (PIs)

1.5.1.

    PIs are volunteers hired according to the processes set by the Executive Board each fall and spring semester.
1.5.2.

    Active Peer Instructors
1.5.2.1.

    PIs are considered active for a specific semester if they are signed up to work six 35-minute shifts per week, actively work those shifts, and remain in good standing at the Hive.
1.5.2.2.

    New active PIs must be trained in 3D printing, laser cutting, and benchtop electronics by the Friday of opening week. They must also be trained in one of the following by the semester class withdrawal deadline: craft, embedded systems, PCB fabrication, machine shop.
1.5.2.3.

    PIs must participate in any events or training/retraining deemed mandatory by the Executive Board.
1.5.2.4.

    PIs must volunteer for at least one event outside of their shift each semester. These events will be communicated by the Executive Board and include workshops, cleaning parties, and other events to be determined. This requirement may also be fulfilled by attendance at a certain number of other events (possibly greater than a single event), such as committee meetings, at the discretion of Staff. What will fulfill a volunteering requirement for a given semester will be communicated by Staff.
1.5.2.5.

    PIs who were active for the spring semester retain active status throughout the summer semester—without the requirement of signing up for and working shifts over the summer—unless they have graduated or otherwise do not plan on being an active PI in the following fall semester.
1.5.2.6.

    Active PIs may access the space 24/7, except on rare occasions as determined by Staff and the Executive Board (for example, the Hive may be closed to PIs during specific events held at the space). Staff and the Executive Board reserve the right to revoke this access for specific PIs at any time.
1.5.3.

    Hiatus Peer Instructors
1.5.3.1.

    PIs on hiatus are those not signed up to work shifts for a specific semester. The purpose of the hiatus status is to allow active PIs to take one or more semesters off working shifts and return to active status at a later date.
1.5.3.2.

    Hiatus PIs do not have access to the space 24/7 and do not retain any other privileges granted to active PIs, including 3D printing privileges. Hiatus PIs retain only the privileges of end users.
1.5.3.3.

    Hiatus PIs who remain in good standing at the Hive may become active again for an upcoming semester by informing the Executive Board of their intention to return to active status and by fulfilling all requirements of an active PI. Hiatus PIs who return to active status regain 24/7 access and any other privileges granted to active PIs.
1.5.3.4.

    If a PI on hiatus for more than 2 consecutive semesters, not including the summer semester, wishes to return to active status, their return must be approved by the Executive Board and they must recomplete the training requirements of a new PI, including the specialty technical area training.
1.5.3.5.

    Any further use of the term PI in this document refers to active PIs, not hiatus PIs.

### 1.6. Master Peer Instructors (MPIs)

1.6.1.

    General Policies
1.6.1.1.

    MPIs are PIs who specialize in a specific technical area and serve as leaders of their technical area.
1.6.1.2.

    MPIs must abide by all policies listed section 1.5 (Peer Instructors), except as outlined in this section, 1.6. **MPIs are considered active PIs and must follow all policies listed in this document that apply to active PIs, unless a specific exception is made.**
1.6.1.3.

    MPIs may go on hiatus and retain their MPI status upon returning as an active PI unless this hiatus is for more than 2 consecutive semesters, not including summer semester. In the case of an MPI returning to active status after 2 such consecutive semesters, the Executive Board will determine whether MPI status shall be retained upon return to active PI status.
1.6.1.4.

    MPIs may request to change their specialty technical area by informing Staff. Changes will only be allowed if Staff and the MPIs of the technical area being changed to agree the change should be made.
1.6.1.5.

    On rare occasions, an individual may be an MPI for more than one technical area at the same time. Such instances must be approved by Staff and the MPIs of the technical areas in question.
1.6.2.

    MPI Requirements
1.6.2.1.

    Failure to meet the following requirements may result MPIs being placed on probation or loss of MPI status, at the discretion of Staff. See section 5.7.
1.6.2.2.

    MPIs are required to work a total of 4 hours per week but are not required to sign up for shifts. These hours are to be referred to as flex hours. They may work these 4 hours at any time during open hours in 30-minute increments.
1.6.2.3.

    All MPIs must either host (or cohost) a workshop once per semester or be actively working on a space improvement project. Either of these also fulfill the PI event volunteering requirement for a semester. Space improvement projects need not be completed independently and may be worked on during an MPI’s flex hours. The progress of space improvement projects will be monitored by Staff.
1.6.2.4.

    MPIs must participate in training new PIs in their technical area each semester. Hours spent training or planning training can count towards flex hours.
1.6.2.5.

    All MPIs are required to participate in the PI hiring process each semester in a manner determined by the Executive Board.
1.6.3.

    Becoming an MPI
1.6.3.1.

    Any PI can apply at any time to become an MPI via the appropriate link on the SharePoint.
1.6.3.2.

    MPI applications will be reviewed as they are received by the current MPIs, the Executive Board, and Staff in a 3-tiered process consisting of the current MPIs of the technical area applied to, the overall MPI population, and the Executive Board/Staff. Final application acceptance shall only be issued by Staff. A member of the technical area in question, the Executive Board, or Staff will reach out to the applicant once a decision has been made. Applicants should note that even if they have a strong application, they may not be accepted if the technical area applied to has enough MPIs.
1.6.3.3.

    Accepted applicants will officially adopt MPI status, and all associated requirements and responsibilities, on a timeline specified by the current MPIs of the technical area, the Executive Board, and Staff. Applicants in their first semester as a PI cannot officially become an MPI until their second semester as a PI begins. As determined by the Executive Board and Staff, someone who becomes an MPI part-way through a semester may or may not have to complete the requirements listed in section 1.6.2 for that semester.
1.6.3.4.

    Certain technical areas may accept MPI applications tentatively but require that applicants complete additional tasks to a satisfactory level before officially being accepted as an MPI and adopting MPI status. Such requirements are regulated by the MPIs of the technical area in question, the Executive Board, and Staff and will be shared with the applicant upon tentative application acceptance.
1.6.3.5.

    Anyone may reapply to be an MPI at any time in the future.

## 2\. General Policies

3.2.3.11.

    Multiple prints of the same models in the queue at the same time, even if queued by multiple individuals, are prohibited unless prior authorization from Staff has been obtained. This policy is intended to prevent printer use for mass printing by a group. For instance, three people part of a project group who each queue three different models would not be in violation of this policy. This policy will be enforced at the discretion of Staff.
3.2.3.12.

    Simple geometries may not be printed in the space. Simple geometries include, but are not limited to, cubes, boxes, prisms, spheres, and cylinders. What constitutes a simple geometry is to be determined at the discretion of the 3D printing MPIs and Staff. Generally, prints that appear to be simple geometries but have slight variations (and thus would be difficult to purchase off the shelf or make on another machine in the space) are allowed.
3.2.3.13.

    Completed prints sitting at the Hive for longer than 2 weeks, or after the space has closed for the semester, are subject to disposal.
3.2.3.14.

    End users and PIs may, in certain instances, print with their own provided materials which are not currently on any Hive printers. Any such prints must be approved by a 3D printing MPI or Staff, and a time must be scheduled to start the print. Only 3D printing MPIs and Staff are allowed to change out any printer materials for ones not provided by The Hive.

## 4\. Peer Instructor Specific Policies

### 4.1. Preface

4.1.1.

    The policies in this section only apply to active Peer Instructors, not end users, hiatus Peer Instructors, or anyone else using the space.

### 4.2. On-Shift Expectations

4.2.1.

    General PI Responsibilities
4.2.1.1.

    Headphones and earbuds must not be worn while on shift. This is for safety reasons and the fact that having headphones on makes a PI seem unavailable for help.
4.2.1.2.

    The appropriate armband must be worn while on shift. PIs have an orange armband, and MPIs have a pink armband.
4.2.1.3.

    Doing homework and being on personal devices is generally allowed while on shift so long as there are no active end users in the space being monitored. Exceptions to this policy are listed for specific technical areas below.
4.2.1.4.

    PIs are expected to be on time for their shift.
4.2.1.5.

    If a PI intends to miss a future shift, they must either schedule a make up shift or trade the shift in SUMS at least 24 hours in advance of it starting. Any make-up shifts must be within 10 days of the missed shift. Staff will monitor whether shifts are made up by referencing SUMS Peer Instructor logins. If a PI requires a timeline extension or an exception to this policy, they should message Staff. Shifts that are missed due to illness, emergency, Institute Approved Absence, or other certain circumstances are excused, do not need to be made up, and may be dropped up until the shift starts (i.e. these situations do not follow the 24 hour rule). If you think you have a circumstance that should be excused, but does not fall under these two categories, contact Staff. However, those missing shifts due to these circumstances must still “drop” their shift if possible and provide a reason in SUMS. If this is done, PIs should not message in #peer-instructors that they are missing their shift. The Hive respects the privacy of its PIs, and thus specific details regarding illness or emergency do not need to be provided. However, general details should be provided if possible (i.e. woke up sick, family emergency, etc.).
4.2.1.6.

    PIs with missed shifts, including shifts that are made up, regardless of if they are called out appropriately and made up, may be subject to disciplinary action at the discretion of Staff. Staff will determine each semester what amount of missed and made-up shifts is egregious. It is expected that PIs will need to miss shifts on occasion for various reasons, and thus one to two appropriately called out and made-up shifts will never be punished.
4.2.1.7.

    PIs may permanently swap their shifts with other PIs if both parties agree and Staff have given their approval.
4.2.2.

    Front Desk PI Responsibilities
4.2.2.1.

    PIs may have their work out even when end users are on the 2nd floor so long as they remain attentive to each end user that approaches the desk and to the 2nd floor as a whole.
4.2.2.2.

    PIs should greet all incoming end users and instruct them to sign in on a SUMS computer. They should ensure all PIs sign in as well. They should ensure all end users and PIs sign out when leaving and give a “thanks for stopping by” or some other salutation. Anyone may leave the space for a short period (i.e. to use the bathroom) without signing out.
4.2.2.3.

    PIs should offer a tour to anyone who is new to the space (if they say they have never been or if they have just signed the waiver on SUMS).
4.2.2.4.

    PIs should be prepared to give tours to anyone who requests one and should offer tours to any groups who enter as part of a campus tour or gathering. People on group tours are not required to sign into SUMS.
4.2.2.5.

    PIs should know what items can be taken from the space and what items must be checked out with a BuzzCard. Policies for every item are listed in the inventory spreadsheet on the front desk computer and on the SharePoint.
4.2.2.6.

    PIs should make note of every item checked out by an end user on a sticky note and place it on their BuzzCard in the lock box.
4.2.2.7.

    The key/BuzzCard lockbox should be closed and locked when not actively in use.
4.2.2.8.

    When a key is returned, PIs should check the station to ensure it is clear of any cables, wires, tools, trash, etc.
4.2.2.9.

    At least once per shift, PIs should check the 2nd floor trash cans to see if they need to be emptied. If so, they should be emptied.
4.2.2.10.

    The entire front desk area must be kept organized. No tools or other materials should be left out of their proper storage place.
4.2.2.11.

    PIs with an opening shift should unlock the front doors and flip the sign to “open” at opening time.
4.2.2.12.

    PIs with Closing Shifts must

  * Announce over the PA system the closing of The Hive 15 minutes prior to and at closing time.
  * Lock the front doors and flip the open sign to “closed.”
  * Ensure all those remaining in the space are PIs or accompanied by a PI. All others should be asked to leave. If end users are unwilling to leave, PIs should contact Staff for assistance. If Staff is present and on-shift, they may handle clearing the space of end-users and inform you that you may end your shift without completing this task.

4.2.3.

    Benchtop Electronics PI Responsibilities
4.2.3.1.

    PIs should make consistent rounds throughout all benchtops, ensuring the following:

  * All who are soldering are wearing safety glasses, even on top of prescription glasses.
  * No equipment (especially soldering equipment) is left on at unattended stations. This includes checking to make sure all irons, the heat press, and other heat elements at the craft stations are unplugged when not in use.
  * All unattended stations are clear of additional cables, tools, or other equipment that should not be there.
  * Any trash/dirt around and under benchtops is swept up, especially loose solder and wire insulation.

4.2.3.2.

    It is acceptable for PIs to sit at the front desk or lectern when not making rounds, but they should not exclusively be there for their entire shift.
4.2.3.3.

    When at the front desk or lectern, PIs may follow the front desk homework guidelines outlined in policy 4.2.2.1.
4.2.4.

    Embedded Systems PI Responsibilities
4.2.4.1.

    PIs on shift for embedded systems should follow all policies for benchtop electronics PIs.
4.2.5.

    Craft PI Responsibilities
4.2.5.1.

    PIs on shift for craft should be sitting in the craft area when not actively assisting anyone.

4.2.5.3.

    PIs should ensure that any heat elements (sublimation printer, irons, etc.) are unplugged when not in use.
4.2.5.4.

    PIs should ensure that any scraps (threads, paper, fabric, etc.) are thrown away or put in the appropriate scrap receptacle.
4.2.6.

    Laser Cutting PI Responsibilities
4.2.6.1.

    PIs may have their homework out when long cuts are running and there is nothing to be actively monitored, but it should be put away when end users need help or something needs monitoring.
4.2.6.2.

    PIs should greet all incoming end users and ask if they need help with anything.
4.2.6.3.

    End users are welcome to set up cuts themselves, but PIs must verify the settings of every print before it starts. PIs must give the go ahead for every laser cut before an end user presses start.
4.2.6.4.

    PIs should ensure the floors of the laser cutting room are always clean, especially keeping an eye out for wood scraps and sawdust.
4.2.6.5.

    PIs should ensure the work bench in the Stratasys room is clear of any trash or debris and clean as necessary.
4.2.6.6.

    At least once per shift, PIs should check the laser cutting room trash can to see if it needs to be emptied and empty it if necessary.
4.2.7.

    3D Printing PI Responsibilities
4.2.7.1.

    PIs may have their homework out if the only end users in the semi-clean room are doing PCB fabrication but should not have it out when end users are present for 3D printing help.
4.2.7.2.

    PIs should greet all incoming end users and ask if they need help with anything.
4.2.7.3.

    PIs should follow all print queuing guidelines communicated in training and posted throughout the semi-clean room.
4.2.7.4.

    PIs should remove any finished prints, keeping in mind the following:

  * This includes processing any resin prints that have finished. PIs should not start processing resin prints if they cannot finish the wash process within their shift or directly pass it off to the next PI on shift. It is acceptable to leave a finished print in the printer in this case if PIs have no time to process it. These policies are intended to prevent the Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) washes from being opened for extended periods.
  * This includes checking the out-of-view printers (Stratasys and Formlabs 3L printers) a few times per shift. Any finished prints should be removed as soon as possible to keep queues moving.

4.2.7.5.

    If a printer malfunctions or gives an error, PIs should attempt to fix it or contact and MPI or Staff for assistance.
4.2.7.6.

    PIs should check the NaOH bath at least once per shift for any finished prints.
4.2.7.7.

    PIs should check the drying rack at least once per shift for any completely dried prints.
4.2.7.8.

    PIs should check the resin curing oven at least once per shift for any completed resin prints.
4.2.7.9.

    PIs should ensure all printers are clear of loose filament debris (especially under the print beds) and should vacuum and sweep them as necessary.
4.2.7.10.

    PIs should ensure the floors of the semi-clean room and Stratasys room are always clean, especially keeping an eye out for loose filament pieces, paper towels, etc. They should sweep and vacuum as necessary.
4.2.7.11.

    At least once per shift, PIs should check the trash cans in the semi-clean room and Stratasys room to see if they need to be emptied and if so empty them.
4.2.7.12.

    PIs should assist or find another PI to assist any PCB end users who need help.
4.2.8.

    Machine Shop PI Responsibilities
4.2.8.1.

    Homework should never be out while end users are in the machine shop. PIs are responsible for monitoring a potentially very dangerous space and must remain attentive to everything that is going on.
4.2.8.2.

    PIs should greet all incoming end users and ask if they need help with anything.
4.2.8.3.

    PIs should consistently keep the floor and workbenches clear of any debris (scraps, sawdust, etc.) and sweep/vacuum as necessary.
4.2.8.4.

    PIs should ensure all unused tools and scraps are put away in the appropriate places.
4.2.8.5.

    PIs should ensure all end users, other PIs, tour groups, and anyone else in the machine shop are wearing safety glasses while any equipment is in use (passive and powered equipment). This includes over prescription eyewear. The only time safety glasses are not required are when certain manual tools such as screwdrivers, wrenches, hand sandpaper, and the like are in use. This is not on a per-user basis. If one person in the shop is using a safety-glasses required tool, everyone in the shop must be wearing safety glasses.
4.2.9.

    Floating PI Responsibilities
4.2.9.1.

    PIs should spend the first 10 minutes of their shift making rounds around the space to see if any spots need to be filled.
4.2.9.2.

    PIs should continue to monitor the slack to see if any spaces need to be filled throughout their shift.
4.2.9.3.

    If not actively filling a spot in another technical area, PIs should be assisting the front desk and benchtop PIs with their duties. They may follow the front desk homework guidelines outlined in section 4.2.2.1.
4.2.9.4.

    It is acceptable for a PI to sit at the front desk or lectern when not making rounds, but they should not be there exclusively for their entire shift.
4.2.9.5.

    Despite policy 4.2.7.3, being a floating PI is not an excuse for one to only do homework during their shift. They are still responsible for monitoring the space.

### 4.3. PI Privileges and After-Hours Use

4.3.1.

    PIs are strictly prohibited from lending their BuzzCard to anyone else, including another PI, for the purposes of getting into the space or using equipment in the space. Violation of this policy will result in a Level 3 infraction and disciplinary action up to being terminated as a PI.
4.3.2.

    PIs are strictly prohibited from letting non-PIs into the space after hours without actively supervising them while being in the space. Another PI being in the space does not absolve one from violating this policy. PIs are allowed to have any number of guests in the space after hours so long as they are always under that PIs supervision. These guests must sign into SUMS. Supervision means being in the same room as all guests and ensuring they follow all policies of end users. Taking a short bathroom or water break is allowed without violating this policy, so long as the PI does not leave the building and so long as guests are not actively using any machinery during the break. Violation of this policy will result in a Level 3 infraction and disciplinary action up to being terminated as a PI.
4.3.3.

    PIs may not have other student organizations as their guests.
4.3.4.

    PIs may be allowed to take certain items outside of the space with Staff permission. Please check with Staff for our current PI checkout policies.
4.3.5.

    PIs are allowed to queue 3D prints at the front of the queues after hours so long as all of the following are true: an active print is not being stopped, the print will finish before The Hive opens, another PIs print is not being passed in the queue, all time and material limits are being followed, all proper print procedures are being followed.
4.3.6.

    PIs are allowed to exceed the time limit for personal laser cuts after hours, so long as they are not preventing another PI from using a laser.
4.3.7.

    Executive Board meetings are open to any active PIs who wish to attend, space permitting. However, PIs must not be disruptive and should be mindful about consistently entering or leaving the meeting space. Meeting minutes are published on the SharePoint.

## 5\. Infractions and Disciplinary Action

5.1.

    Violations of any of the policies in this document may result in infractions and disciplinary action. Staff have the ultimate authority to take disciplinary action to do so without regard to the infraction model described below. However, in most cases, the following infraction model will be used.
5.2.

    Infractions are given in 4 levels, each with increasing severity. Such infractions are described in the following table:

Level | Type | Consequence  
---|---|---  
0 | Warning | Verbal warning, documented in Slack.  
1 | Minimal | Written warning in SUMS. Violator will receive an email.  
2 | Moderate | 2-week suspension from the space.  
3 | Severe | Longer suspension from the space, up to a permanent ban. Staff will determine the appropriate timeframe on a case-by-case basis.  
5.3.

    Level 0 infractions (warnings) may be issued by any PI to an end user and reported in Slack to Staff. Only MPIs and Staff may issue Level 0 infractions to other PIs. Level 1-3 infractions may only be issued by Staff. A record of infractions by PIs and end users will be maintained by Staff.
5.4.

    Multiple level 0 or level 1 infractions may result in a level 2 or 3 infraction. Multiple level 2 infractions may result in a level 3 infraction.
5.5.

    Active PIs who commit infractions may be subject to additional disciplinary action as determined by Staff. Generally, warnings and minimal infractions do not warrant any additional disciplinary action. However, higher level infractions may result in a PI being placed on hiatus for one or more semesters, being placed on probation, or being terminated as a PI.
5.6.

    The automated written warnings issued by SUMS when an individual forgets to sign out of the space do not constitute a level 0 infraction unless there have been multiple occurrences and Staff deems that a level 0 or higher infraction is appropriate.
5.7.

    PI Probation
5.7.1.

    Active PIs who fail to meet certain requirements of being active PIs may be placed on probation. PIs will be informed if they are placed on probation. There are two types of PI probation: Volunteer Probation and Shift Probation. If an MPI is placed on either type of probation, they are subject to the loss of MPI status at the discretion of Staff.
5.7.2.

    Volunteer Probation
5.7.2.1.

    PIs who fail to meet their volunteering requirement (as described in section 1.5) by the specified deadline will be placed on Volunteer Probation. MPIs who fail to meet their semesterly requirements (as outlined in section 1.6.2) by the specified deadlines will be placed on Volunteer Probation.
5.7.2.2.

    PIs on Volunteer Probation are placed on a **permanent** list maintained by Staff. If a PI fails to complete **any** subsequent volunteering or MPI-specific requirement, that PI will be dismissed.
5.7.3.

    Shift Probation
5.7.3.1.

    PIs who are missing a significant number of shift hours (as determined by Staff and not including excused absences) will be placed on Shift Probation.
5.7.3.2.

    PIs on shift probation will be closely monitored in their next semester as an active PI who works shifts. If they continue to have unexcused shift absences, they will be dismissed. If they work all required shift hours (not accounting for excused absences), they will be removed from Shift Probation at the end of the semester.
5.7.3.3.

    PIs who are missing a **very** significant number of shift hours in a given semester (as determined by Staff and not including excused absences) will be dismissed without being placed on probation.
