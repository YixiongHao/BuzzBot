Laboratory for Emerging Devices and Circuits at School of Electrical and
Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology is directed by Prof.
Shimeng Yu.

We design the energy-efficient computing system based on emerging
semiconductor devices and 3D integration technologies, for example, the
hardware accelerators for machine/deep learning with CMOS and beyond CMOS
(resistive and ferroelectric) technologies.

Our research expands from nanofabrication, device modeling, circuit-device
interaction, prototype chip design and tape-out, design automation, to
architecture and algorithms co-optimization. Experimental research activities
are performed with facilities in the cleanroom at the Georgia Institute of
Technology.

Our current projects are sponsored by NSF, DARPA, DOE, SRC/DARPA JUMP 2.0
program, and industry (including TSMC, Intel, Samsung, IMEC, etc.). Cumulative
funding of our research group exceeds >$15M.

Our lab is located at Pettit Microelectronics Research Center at Georgia Tech
main campus.

Address: 791 Atlantic Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332

Direction: After arriving at visitor parking area 4 across the Marcus
Nanotechnology Building (345 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30318), follow a short
walking path.
