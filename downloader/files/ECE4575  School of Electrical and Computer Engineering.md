### Course Outcomes

  1. Students will be able to write computer code to implement linear system constructs learned in prior S+C courses. 
  2. Students will understand the types of errors than can arise in these implementations, and how to quantify them. 
  3. Students will be able to construct computer algorithms to solve other problems which don't benefit from closed form constructs acquired in previous
  4. Students will know which types of models should be paired with which types of numerical optimization algorithms based on properties such as convexi
  5. In cases were multiple choices of numerical optimization algorithms are suitable for a given problem, students will understand the relative advanta

### Student Outcomes

In the parentheses for each Student Outcome:  
"P" for primary indicates the outcome is a major focus of the entire course.  
“M” for moderate indicates the outcome is the focus of at least one component
of the course, but not majority of course material.  
“LN” for “little to none” indicates that the course does not contribute
significantly to this outcome.

1\. ( P ) An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering
problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics

2\. ( LN ) An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that
meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare,
as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors

3\. ( LN ) An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences

4\. ( LN ) An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities
in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the
impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and
societal contexts

5\. ( M ) An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together
provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment,
establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives

6\. ( P ) An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation,
analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions

7\. ( M ) An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using
appropriate learning strategies.
