Biography

Patricio Vela was born in Mexico City, Mexico and grew up in California. He
earned his bachelor of science degree in 1998 and his doctorate in 2003 at the
California Institute of Technology, where he did his graduate research on
geometric nonlinear control androbotics. Dr. Vela came to Georgia Tech as a
post-doctoral researcher in computer vision and joined the ECE faculty in
2005.

His research interests lie in the geometric perspectives to control theory and
computer vision. Recently, he has been interested in the role that computer
vision can play for achieving control-theoretic objectives of
(semi-)autonomous systems. His research also covers control of nonlinear
systems, typically robotic systems.
