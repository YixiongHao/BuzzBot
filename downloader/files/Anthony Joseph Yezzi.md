Biography

Professor Yezzi was born in Gainsville, Florida and grew up in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He obtained both his Bachelor's degree and his Ph.D. in the
Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Minnesota with
minors in mathematics and music.

After completing his Ph.D., he continued his research as a post-Doctoral
Research Associate at the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, MA.

His research interests fall broadly within the fields of image processing and
computer vision. In particular he is interested in curve and surface evolution
theory and partial differential equation techniques as they apply to topics
within these fields (such as segmentation, image smoothing and enhancement,
optical flow, stereo disparity, shape from shading, object recognition, and
visual tracking).

Much of Dr. Yezzi's work is particularly tailored to problems in medical
imaging, including cardiac ultrasound, MRI, and CT. He joined the Georgia Tech
faculty in the fall of 1999 where he has taught courses in DSP and is working
to develop advanced courses in computer vision and medical image processing.
Professor Yezzi consults with industry in the areas of visual inspection and
medical imaging. His hobbies include classical guitar, opera, and martial
arts.
