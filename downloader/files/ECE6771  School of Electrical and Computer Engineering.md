### Strategic Performance Indicators (SPIs)

Outcome 1 (Students will demonstrate expertise in a subfield of study chosen
from the fields of electrical engineering or computer engineering):  
1\. Explain the fundamental physical concepts associated with the materials,
devices and processes used to produce, detect, or control light.  
2\. Relate basic physical concepts to the principle of operation, performance,
and future optimization of optoelectronic devices and systems.

materials and waveguides, the nonlinear optical properties of electro-optic
materials, and apply that knowledge to design and test electro-optic light
modulators.  
2\. Understand the principles of light emission in organic and inorganic
semiconductors, determine the luminance, quantum efficiency, and luminous
efficiency of light sources, and design displays and signage based on light-
emitting diodes.

Outcome 3 (Students will demonstrate the ability to utilize current knowledge,
technology, or techniques within their chosen subfield):  
1\. Design, fabricate, and test optoelectronics devices such as electro-optic
devices, light-emitting diodes and lasers, photovoltaics devices and modules,
photodetectors, and sensors.
