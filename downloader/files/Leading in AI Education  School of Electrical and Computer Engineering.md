## Georgia Tech ECE is pioneering a future where artificial intelligence (AI)
is strategically integrated into all aspects of learning, enriching the
educational journey for today’s students, and empowering the next generation
of leaders.



As AI continues to transform our everyday lives, we recognize the importance
of equipping students with the skills and knowledge to thrive in an AI-driven
world.  
This year, the College of Engineering (CoE) took decisive steps forward like
introducing the AI Makerspace in partnership with NVIDIA and Penguin
Computing. ECE was proud to play a leading role in making this one-of-a-kind
AI supercomputer designed specifically for students a reality. Additionally,
along with CoE, we’ve developed and strengthened AI courses and opportunities
for students to pursue, ensuring they’re prepared for the challenges and
opportunities of tomorrow.

As leaders in AI, we understand that AI transcends the virtual realm of
algorithms and advanced computing technology. It profoundly influences and
advances tangible aspects of the physical world today. AI is already making
its powerful and unique impression on all corners of the human experience.
Recognizing the unpredictable nature of powerful change, we choose to actively
lead where AI and humanity meet.

resources typically reserved for researchers or technology companies. Students
will access the cluster online as part of their coursework, deepening their AI
skills through hands-on experience. The Makerspace will also better position
students after graduation as they work with AI professionals and help shape
the technology’s future applications. “The AI Makerspace represents a
significant advancement in technology for education,” explains Arijit
Raychowdhury, professor and Steve W. Chaddick School Chair of Electrical and
Computer Engineering. “To draw a comparison, the makerspace will provide a
technological upgrade equivalent to switching from an etch-a-sketch to an
iPad. That’s the level of difference in technology that the AI Makerspace
provides to students.”

**Powering the AI Makerspace**  
The Georgia Tech AI Makerspace is a dedicated computing cluster paired with
NVIDIA AI Enterprise software. The software technology resides on an advanced
AI infrastructure that is designed, built, and deployed by Penguin Solutions,
providing a virtual gateway to a high-performance computing environment.

The first phase of the endeavor is powered by:  
• 20 NVIDIA HGX H100 systems  
• 160 NVIDIA H100 GPUs  
• 1,280 Intel Sapphire Rapids CPU cores  
• 40TB 4800 MHz DDR5 DRAM  
• 230.4 TB NVMe storage

**NVIDIA Chief Scientist Talks Future of AI Hardware at ECE Distinguished
Lecture**

Bill Dally, chief scientist at NVIDIA, visited the Georgia Tech campus on
April 10, 2024, to deliver a Distinguished Lecture hosted by the School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering.  
During his lecture on “Directions in Deep Learning Hardware,” Dally provided
valuable insights into the evolving landscape of hardware as artificial
intelligence (AI) continues to shape the field. He highlighted some of
NVIDIA’s recent advancements, including the company’s recently announced
Blackwell architecture, while addressing the challenges and opportunities that
lie ahead.

##### **Georgia Tech Professor: Banning AI from school is a mistake**

The op-ed in Fortune from ECE School Chair Arijit Raychowdhury calls on
educators to set students on the right path with AI, making the case that AI
is the next technology that every student needs to know a bit about to
navigate our modern times.
