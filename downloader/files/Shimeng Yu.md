Biography

Shimeng Yu is a full professor of electrical and computer engineering at
Georgia Institute of Technology, where he holds the Dean’s Professorship. He
received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University in 2009,
and the M.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford
University in 2011 and 2013, respectively. From 2013 to 2018, he was an
assistant professor at Arizona State University. He is elevated for the IEEE
Fellow for contributions to non-volatile memories and in-memory computing.  
  
Prof. Yu’s general research interests are semiconductor devices and integrated
circuits for energy-efficient computing systems. His expertise is on the
emerging non-volatile memories for AI hardware and 3D integration. Prof. Yu’s
400+ journal/conference publications received more than 30,000 citations
(Google Scholar) with H-index 82. He is the theme lead of two SRC/DARPA JUMP
2.0 centers on intelligent memory/storage and heterogeneous/monolithic 3D
integration.  
  
Prof. Yu serves in flagship conferences in the field as technical program
committee, including IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM), IEEE
Symposium on VLSI Technology and Circuits, etc. He also serves an editor for
IEEE Electron Device Letters (EDL), and associate editor-in-chief for IEEE
Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems (JETCAS).
